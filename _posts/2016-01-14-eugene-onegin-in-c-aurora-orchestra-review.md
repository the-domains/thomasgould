description: "Before the premiere of Eugene Onegin in 1879, Tchaikovsky begged the chorus not to behave like sheep, the conductor not to be a machine, the production not to be too opulent. Royal Opera's 2013 staging directed by Kasper Holten, now revived and reworked after performances in Turin and Australia, obeys these requests to a fair degree."
